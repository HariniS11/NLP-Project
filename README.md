# 🎯 My Zoom: A Transformer-Based Model for Contextual Feedback Validation

## 📌 Project Overview
**My Zoom** is an advanced NLP system that leverages **Transformer-based models** to validate feedback in a contextual and intelligent manner. The goal is to ensure that user feedback is relevant, aligned, and meaningful with respect to the original conversation or prompt.

This model can be deployed in platforms like video conferencing apps, customer support tools, or educational feedback systems where validating the relevance and quality of feedback is crucial.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Feedback collected from users (students, customers, clients) often lacks **contextual alignment**, making it difficult to act upon. Traditional rule-based methods fail to understand the **semantic meaning** and **intent** behind the feedback.

### ✅ Objective:
To build a **context-aware feedback validation system** using **Transformer models like BERT/DistilBERT** to:
- Detect if feedback is contextually relevant.
- Filter out off-topic or generic responses.
- Provide a binary output (Aligned / Not Aligned).

---

## ⚙️ Model Architecture

- **Model Type:** Transformer-based Binary Text Classifier
- **Base Model:** `DistilBERT` (can be swapped with BERT or RoBERTa)
- **Input:** 
  - `text` (original context or conversation)
  - `reason` (user feedback)
- **Output:** 
  - `label` → 1 (Aligned), 0 (Not Aligned)

### 🔍 Features:
- Tokenization using `BERT tokenizer`
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific labeled data
- Evaluation using `Accuracy`, `Precision`, `Recall`, and `F1-score`

---

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Custom dataset with the following columns:
  - `text`: The original conversation/context
  - `reason`: The feedback or response
  - `label`: Ground truth label (1 for aligned, 0 for not aligned)
- Preprocessing:
  - Tokenization and attention masking
  - Balanced and cleaned dataset
  - Train/Test split

|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   | 94% |
| Precision  | 92% |
| Recall     | 95% |
| F1-Score   | 94% |
